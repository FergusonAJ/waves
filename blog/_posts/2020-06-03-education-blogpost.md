Outline

When Life Interferes

These are not the circumstances under which I expected to be completing my first summer research experience.

COVID shut down my university March 11.

(insert bulleted list of generally how school and research have functioned since then)

Rise in BLM protests across the world sparked by the death of George Floyd

As a society, we’ve shifted our focus onto the identities others hold, and how these identities have affected their life experiences.

In this workshop, we’ve talked to both participants (meta!) and mentors about their own identities.

How do they think of themselves as scientists or programmers?

How do they feel about their specific research?

How has their background affected their career goals?

Our Process

Outlines the specific steps we took in research.

  Consent Survey
  
Initial Interviews

Background information

What their parents did

Interests as a child

Middle school/high school/undergraduate STEM experiences

Inequities faced in life, in school, and in work

PITTS Midpoint Survey

How are you feeling about your research?

What is your confidence as a scientist or researcher?

How do you view yourself as a scientist overall?

Exit Interviews

How was your WAVES experience?

What People Are Saying

A section of my blog post where I’ll put common themes of interviews, plus things of interest that stood out… (potential examples below)

A Fish Out of Water

I am an aspiring microbiologist and STEM education researcher- not a computer scientist. My experience working with others (mostly) from a different discipline:

We had more in common than I thought, evolution education being a big focus of this lab.

I was able to learn about the perspectives of those in a different discipline.

In small group discussions, I was able to discuss and explain microbiological concepts (related to the novel coronavirus) to others in my group- virtually all older peers/coworkers.

Their experiences as humans growing up to be scientists or programmers had common elements.

Sense of curiosity, family members studying the same thing, or a positive undergraduate experience.

This experience reminded me how interdisciplinary science is.

Even though this field is alien to me, I felt like I could connect due to our shared passions and characteristics that draw us to STEM in the first place.

Conclusions

Social barriers can exist in any field and at any level of education.

Despite these varying barriers, similar elements drive people to study STEM.
