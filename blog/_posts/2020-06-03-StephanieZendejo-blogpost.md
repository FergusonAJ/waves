## Introduction to MABE :dna:
During the Summer of 2020, I had the pleasure of participating in the WAVES workshop and making contributions to MABE (Modular Agent-Based Evolution). **MABE is a tool for evolving and analyzing digital brains.** :exploding_head:  Users create and manage populations of evolving digital organisms which are then evaluated in worlds. The results of the evaluations dictate the generations of new populations by means of natural, artificial, and/or sexual selection.  

The purpose of MABE is twofold:
1. Support academic research into topics related to evolution

2. Provide insight into evolution and evolutionary processes  


## What are Genomes? We just don't know.

I realized in order have a better understanding of the project at hand, I needed a refresher in biology. The last time I had taken a biology course was _nine_ years ago. The only thing I distinctly remembered was that _the mitochondria was the powerhouse of the cell_.

It was time for an evolutionary biology bootcamp.  

I familiarized myself with terms such as fitness function, selection scheme, and mutation. Once I had a good handle on that, I worked on understanding how MABE works. 
![MABE Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Hintzelab/MABE/images/MABE_Overview.png)
- **Digital organisms** contain a brain which determine how the organisms interact in   their environment (or world), and a genome, which provides a blueprint for the brain. A   collection of organisms make up a population.

- **Archivist** is synonymous with a person who collects all data and decides what   data to be stored.

- **Optimizer** is synonmyous with a person who decides which organisms will produce the next generation.

- A **Group** in MABE is made up of a population of digital organisms, an optimizer, and archivist.
