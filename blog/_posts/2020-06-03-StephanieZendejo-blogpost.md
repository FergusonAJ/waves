# Introduction to MABE :dna:
During the Summer of 2020, I had the pleasure of participating in the WAVES workshop and making contributions to MABE (Modular Agent-Based Evolution). **MABE is a tool for evolving and analyzing digital brains.** :exploding_head:  Users create and manage populations of evolving digital organisms which are then evaluated in worlds. The results of the evaluations dictate the generations of new populations by means of natural, artificial, and/or sexual selection.  

The purpose of MABE is twofold:
1. Support academic research into topics related to evolution

2. Provide insight into evolution and evolutionary processes  



# What are Digital Organisms? We just don't know.

I realized in order to have a better understanding of the project, I needed a refresher in biology. The last time I had taken a biology course was _nine_ years ago. The only thing I distinctly remembered was that _the mitochondria was the powerhouse of the cell_. I put myself through an evolutionary biology bootcamp. Once I had a good handle on terms and definitions, I worked on understanding how MABE works. 

![MABE Overview](https://i.imgur.com/WwKJYt4.png)  
**Figure MABE Structure.** _A broad overview of how MABE is structured, synonymous with how organisms evolve in the real world_  
- **Digital organisms** contain a brain which determine how the organisms interact in their environment (or world), and a genome, which provides a blueprint for the brain. A collection of organisms make up a population.

- **Archivist** is synonymous with a person who collects all data and decides what data to be stored.

- **Optimizer** is synonmyous with a person who decides which organisms in a population will produce the next generation of organisms.

- A **Group** in MABE is made up of a population of digital organisms, an optimizer, and archivist.

### Mutations
Mutations can occur in genomes. If an organism progresses to the next generation, mutations applied to the genome introduces new genetic variation into the population. In other words, a (parent) genome generates a mutated offspring genome. There are three basic mutations that can occur:
- **Overwrite:** changes the value of a single site in the genome

- **Insert:** inserts sites to the genome, changing the genome size and causing offsets

- **Remove:** removes sites from the genome, changing the genome size, and causing offsets

### Genome Class
> Genomes are often large, and undergo _several_ mutations.  

The Genome Class in MABE sets aside a chunk of contiguous memory for every genome for the organisms that progress to the next generation. It then copies the parent genome over to the contiguous memory, applies the mutations, and voila! :tada: Offspring genomes are generated. Contiguous memory for genomes is assigned and written to at every next generation. If the frequency of generating offspring genomes was reduced, could the proposed method save **time** and **memory**?

# Hello Changelog!
The idea for a changelog is to record the mutations that a genome has undergone. In this way, an offspring genome would not have to be generated at every generation. The offspring genome could be generated by applying recorded mutations in the changelog to the parent genome. I set out to answer that question with my team members.

## My Approach
We can think of the parent genome as a vector of sites, where each site contains a number. 
> Insert Parent Genome Here

A changelog is represented as a map of key size_t and value Site. The location of the site in the parent genome is the key, and the details of the site affected is the value. The site affected, represented as a Site struct, helps identify what type of mutation has been applied to the site.
```c++
struct Site {
	size_t insertOffset;  	  // insert mutation at site
	size_t removeOffset;   	  // remove mutation at site
	std::byte value;       	  // mutated number value
};	
std::map<size_t, Site> changelog; // key is index of site in the parent genome
                                  // value is Site structure
std::vector<std::byte> sites;     // parent genome
```
### Mutation Signatures
**Overwrite**  
  * Loops through segment vector
  * Adds overwrite mutations to the changelog 

**Insert**  
  * Shift sites in the changelog to the right by size of the segment vector
  * Loops through segment vector
  * Adds insert mutations to the changelog  

**Remove**  
  * Removes sites in the changelog if they exist
     * Takes into account if sites removed in the changelog had insert or remove mutations
  * Shift sites in the changelog to the left
  * Adds remove mutation to the changelog  
  
The overwrite and insert signatures contain a segment vector as an argument. The segment vector is a collection of mutations that will be added to the changelog starting at the given index. 
> _insert(6, {44, 55, 66}) is the equivalent of inserting the following mutations to the changelog:_   
> _site at index 6 with a value of 44_  
> _site at index 7 with a value of 55_  
> _site at index 8 with a value of 66_  
```c++
virtual void overwrite(size_t index, const std::vector<std::byte>& segment); 
		// Ex. Starting at index 5, overwrite 3 sites with the values 11, 22, 33

virtual void insert(size_t index, const std::vector<std::byte>& segment);    
		// Ex. Starting at index 6, insert 3 new sites with the values 44, 55, 66

virtual void remove(size_t index, size_t segmentSize) override; 	     
		// Ex. At index 7, remove 3 sites
```

### Adding Entries In The Changelog
Let's apply some basic mutations to the parent genome.  

1. Overwrite site at index 2 with a new value of 44  
   | Key | Site Value | Remove Offset  | Insert Offset |  
   | --- |:----------:|:--------------:| -------------:|  
   |  2  |     44     |       0        |       0       |  

   _Add entry to Changelog map at key 2. Site Value is set to 44. Since this is an overwrite mutation, the size of the parent genome is not affected. Remove Offset and Insert   offset are both set to zero._  

2. Remove 2 sites at index 4  
   | Key | Site Value | Remove Offset  | Insert Offset |  
   | --- |:----------:|:--------------:| -------------:|  
   |  2  |     44     |       0        |       0       |  
   |  4  |      0     |       2        |       0       |  

   _Add entry to Changelog map at key 4. Site Value remains empty, since this is a remove mutation. Remove Offset is set to 2, the number of sites removed._  

3. Insert 1 site at index 1 with a new site value of 66  
   | Key | Site Value | Remove Offset  | Insert Offset |  
   | --- |:----------:|:--------------:| -------------:|  
   |  1  |     66     |       0        |       1       |  
   |  3  |     44     |       0        |       0       |  
   |  5  |      0     |       2        |       0       |  

   _Add entry to Changelog map at key 1. Site Value is set to 66. Insert Offset is set to 1, the number of sites inserted. Shift all remaining sites in changelog to the right by one._
