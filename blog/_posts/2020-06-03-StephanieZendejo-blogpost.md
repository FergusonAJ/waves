## Introduction to MABE :dna:
During the Summer of 2020, I had the pleasure of participating in the WAVES workshop and making contributions to MABE (Modular Agent-Based Evolution). **MABE is a tool for evolving and analyzing digital brains.** :exploding_head:  Users create and manage populations of evolving digital organisms which are then evaluated in worlds. The results of the evaluations dictate the generations of new populations by means of natural, artificial, and/or sexual selection.  

The purpose of MABE is twofold:
1. Support academic research into topics related to evolution

2. Provide insight into evolution and evolutionary processes  



## What are Digital Organisms? We just don't know.

I realized in order have a better understanding of the project, I needed a refresher in biology. The last time I had taken a biology course was _nine_ years ago. The only thing I distinctly remembered was that _the mitochondria was the powerhouse of the cell_. I put myself through an evolutionary biology bootcamp. Once I had a good handle on terms and definitions, I worked on understanding how MABE works. 

![MABE Overview](https://i.imgur.com/jZvYNYb.png)
- **Digital organisms** contain a brain which determine how the organisms interact in their environment (or world), and a genome, which provides a blueprint for the brain. A collection of organisms make up a population.

- **Archivist** is synonymous with a person who collects all data and decides what data to be stored.

- **Optimizer** is synonmyous with a person who decides which organisms in a population will produce the next generation of organisms.

- A **Group** in MABE is made up of a population of digital organisms, an optimizer, and archivist.

### Mutations :biohazard:
Mutations can occur in genomes. If an organism progresses to the next generation, mutations applied to the genome introduces new genetic variation into the population. In other words, a (parent) genome generates a mutated offspring genome. There are three basic mutations that can occur:
- **Overwrite:** changes the value of a single site in the genome

- **Insert:** inserts sites to the genome, changing the genome size and causing offsets

- **Remove:** removes sites from the genome, changing the genome size, and causing offsets

### Genome Class in MABE
Genomes are often large, and undergo several mutations. The genome class in MABE sets aside a chunk of contiguous memory for every genome for the organisms that progress to the next generation. It then copies the parent genome over to the contiguous memory, applies the mutations, and voila! Offspring genomes are generated.  
Contiguous memory for genomes is assigned and written to at every generation, for every genome in a new generation. If the frequency of generating offspring genomes was reduced, would it could save time and memory?

## Hello Changelog
The idea for a changelog is to record the mutations that a genome has undergone. In this way, an offspring genome would not have to be generated at every generation. The offspring genome could be generated by applying recorded mutations in the changelog to the parent genome. I set out to answer that question with my team members.

### My Approach
We can think of the parent genome as a vector of sites, where each site contains a number. 
> Insert Parent Genome Here

A changelog consists of the location of the site in the parent genome as the key, and the site affected as the value. The site affected is represented as a data structure, and helps identify what type of mutation has been applied to the site.
```c++
struct Site {
	size_t insertOffset;    // insert mutation at site
	size_t removeOffset;    // remove mutation at site
	std::byte value;        // mutated number value
};
std::map<size_t, Site> changelog; // key is index of site in the parent genome
                                  // value is Site structure
std::vector<std::byte> sites;     // parent genome
```

**Let's apply some basic mutations to the parent genome.**  

Overwrite site at index 2 with a value of 44
> **Changelog**  
> | Key | Site Value | Remove Offset  | Insert Offset |
> | --- |:----------:|:--------------:| -------------:|
> |  2  |     44     |       0        |       0       |  
> Add entry to Changelog map at key 2. Site Value is set to 44. Since this is an overwrite mutation, the size of the parent genome is not affected. Remove Offset and Insert offset are both set to zero.

Remove 2 sites at index 4  
> **Changelog** 
> | Key | Site Value | Remove Offset  | Insert Offset |
> | --- |:----------:|:--------------:| -------------:|
> |  2  |     44     |       0        |       0       |  
> |  4  |      0     |       2        |       0       |  
> Add entry to Changelog map at key 4. Site Value remains empty, since this is a remove mutation. Remove Offset is set to 2, the number of sites removed.

Insert 1 site at index 1 with a value of 66
> **Changelog** 
> | Key | Site Value | Remove Offset  | Insert Offset |
> | --- |:----------:|:--------------:| -------------:|
> |  1  |     66     |       0        |       1       |  
> |  3  |     44     |       0        |       0       |  
> |  5  |      0     |       2        |       0       |  
> Add entry to Changelog map at key 1. Site Value is set to 66. Insert Offset is set to 1, the number of sites inserted. Shift all remaining sites in changelog to the right by one.
