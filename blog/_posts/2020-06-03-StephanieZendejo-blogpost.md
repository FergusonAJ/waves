## Introduction to MABE :dna:
During the Summer of 2020, I had the pleasure of participating in the WAVES workshop and making contributions to MABE. **MABE (Modular Agent-Based Evolution) is a tool for evolving and analyzing digital brains.** :exploding_head:  Users create and manage populations of evolving digital organisms which are then evaluated in worlds. The results of the evaluations dictate the generations of new populations by means of natural, artificial, and/or sexual selection.  

The purpose of MABE is twofold:
1. Support academic research into topics related to evolution

2. Provide insight into evolution and evolutionary processes
