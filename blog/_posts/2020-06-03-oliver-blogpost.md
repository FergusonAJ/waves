Hi! I'm a rising senior at Amherst College originally from Evanston, Illinois (I recently moved to New Orleans) and am double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm especially interested in evolutionary computation and interactive data visualizations. Outside of that, I enjoy photography, playing the piano, and climbing.
