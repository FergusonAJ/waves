## Project Introduction
MABE, or Modular Agent Based Evolution Framework, is a platform which allows users to create populations of digital organisms and analyze the effects of virtually evolving these populations. One of the key components of MABE is the genome class, which represents genomes for digital organisms in the population. The goal of this project is to advance the genome class in MABE by optimizing its memory consumption and runtime.

## Genomes in MABE 1.0
Genomes are currently represented as lists of values which can be read from, written to, and mutated from parent to offspring. Every genome has a contiguous piece of memory to store its values.

## The Problem
- Genomes are often very large, from hundreds of thousands of sites to millions of sites.
- Genomes in MABE 1.0 are copied from parent to offspring, and the offspring will contain some mutations from the parent.
- However, with large genome sizes and low mutation rates, the number of sites mutated in an offspring is usually significantly less than the number of sites which remain the same between parent and offspring. This makes the current genome class‚Äôs approach of directly copying genomes from parent to offspring very inefficient in terms of time and memory, much like the gif below!

## Change Logging as a Solution
- With change logging, genomes will only store the differences between parent and offspring genomes. Each genome will keep track of a log of changes, documenting the mutations between the last saved ‚Äúparent‚Äù genome and the current genome. The ‚Äúparent‚Äù genome will be reset whenever the changelog becomes too large. 
- Using the changelog, the current genome can be reconstructed. 
- Any random site in the current genome can also be accessed without having to store a full copy of the current genome. 
- Thus, change logging can save significant time and memory, especially for larger genomes. 

## My Algorithm for Genomes with Change Logging
- **Data Structures:**
  - Each genome stores a changelog and an offset map.
    - **Changelog: ordered map**
      - The key represents the position in the current genome and the value represents the value at that position in the current genome.
      - Everything in the changelog will be values that aren‚Äôt in the parent genome, that have either been inserted or changed in the current genome through mutations.
    - **Offset map: ordered map**
      - We use the offset map for all keys that are not in the changelog. The key represents a position in the current genome. The value is the offset (how much that position has shifted from the parent genome to the current genome). 
      - The offset map can be viewed in ranges, where keys between key A and B have the offset of key A (the lower bound).
      - When a key x isn‚Äôt in the changelog, we find the closest key in the offset map and subtract its offset from x to get the position in the parent. We can then access the correct value in the parent.
      - The offset map will always begin with a single key-value pair (0,0) to indicate that all positions 0 onward have not been shifted/offsetted yet.

- **Insert, Remove, and Overwrite Mutations:**
  - **Insert mutation:** inserts value(s) at a certain position in current genome and changes genome size
    - The demo below goes through all of the steps involved in an insertion:

  - **Remove mutation:** deletes value(s) at a certain position in current genome and changes genome size
    - The demo below goes through all of the steps involved in a deletion/remove:
     ![remove demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uma-sethuraman/RemoveDemo.gif){:style="width: 100%;"}
  - **Overwrite mutation:** change the value of a single or multiple sites in the genome
    - The demo below goes through all of the steps involved in an overwrite:
    ![overwrite demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uma-sethuraman/OverwriteDemo.gif){:style="width: 100%;"}
      
- **Random Access:**
  - Pseudocode to access position pos in the current genome:
    ``` C++
    if (pos in changelog) {
      /* pos is in changelog because it has been inserted 
      or modified since the parent genome so return the value
      from changelog. */
      
      return changelog[pos];
    }
    else {
      /* pos isn't in changelog so find the offset of pos 
      or the closest key less than pos in the offset map. */
      
      int offset = 0;
      if (pos in offsetMap)
        offset = offsetMap[pos]
      else
        offset = offsetMap[closest key less than pos];
        
      /* subtract offset from pos to get the position in the parent
      before any shifting happened in the current genome. */
      
      return parentGenome[pos-offset]
    }
    ```
  - This implementation allows for fast random access. In the case that the requested position is in the changelog, the time complexity is `O(logn)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the changelog. This is because we check if the requested position is in the changelog before returning the value. In the case that the requested position is not in the changelog, the time complexity is `O(log(mn))`, where `m` is the number of elements in the offset map and `n` is the number of elements in the changelog. This is because we check if the requested position is in the changelog first (`logn`). Since it isn't in this case, we also check if the position is in the offset map (`logm`), and `logm+logn = O(log(mn))`.
  
## Results: 
  - Analysis of time and space complexity of my implementation
  - Graphs comparing the time/space complexity and performance of the current MABE genome implementation to my implementation
  - Benchmarking of the different implementations is done through catch2.
  - Results not yet finalized
  
## Conclusion:
- I‚Äôve really enjoyed working on this project with a great team of participants and mentors. It‚Äôs been so helpful to have a team to collaborate with, debug with, bounce ideas off of, and learn from. Each participant in my team implemented a different algorithm for this problem in order to test out multiple diffferent solutions. I‚Äôm really excited to have contributed to advancing genomes in MABE through my project this summer. I can‚Äôt wait to see how not only genomes but all parts of MABE will continue to evolve (pun intendedüòÇ) in the future! Thank you to my wonderful mentors and great teammates who I‚Äôve listed below! Thank you also to the entire WAVES team who has made this summer program's experience so amazing!
