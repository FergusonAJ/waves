Description: I am working to eventually implement a better drag and drop feauture to Avida-ed 4 that works on touch screen devices and can be used in classrooms. This feature will allow users to drag objects from the freezer and use it to populate the canvas, it will also allow movement on the canvas, movment to resources and movment of objects to trash.

## Objectives
* #### To find .js Library that enables drag and drop features on touch devices
* #### Build sample web app to be run on any touchscreen device
* #### use web app to demonstrate how it can meet all desired requirements for Avida-ed 4
