I am working on MABE project. Up to now, with help of my mentors, Cliff and Jory, I have been familiarizing myself with MABE code by implementing World classes, which use Genomes and Brains. I will be working on new, more efficient Genome class. New Genome class will probably have read and write methods through direct memory access. Our team has been brainstorming other potential optimization solutions, like implementing change log and gene tracking.
